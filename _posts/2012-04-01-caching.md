# {{page.title}}

ApiAxle supports caching. The following details the flow and you can
[take a peek at the relevant source code](https://github.com/philjackson/apiaxle/blob/master/proxy/app/controller/catchall_controller.coffee#L21) if that's more your thing.

## Global cache

You can optionally set a cache time (in seconds) on a per-api basis by
passing an option to the provisioning script:

    ./bin/new-api.coffee --global-cache=20 --end-point=graph.facebook.com facebook
    
This will give every endpoint of the `facebook` Api a global cache
time of 20 seconds. You can override this with cache-control.

## Cache-control

Axle supports the following pragmas of the cache-control spec:

### s-maxage

Setting s-maxage will make ApiAxle cache your call for as many
seconds as you pass. This overrides the global cache and can be
overridden by the `no-cache` or `proxy-revalidate` pragma.

### proxy-revalidate

Setting this pragma will force Axle to make the backend HTTP call
before caching it again for the amount of time specified by the global
cache or `s-maxage`.

### no-cache

Don't cache the call being made. Overrides the global cache and `s-maxage`.

## What's cached?

* The HTTP status code.
* The `content-type` header.
* The body of the call.

## For which verbs?

Only GETs are cached (probably HEADs in the future).

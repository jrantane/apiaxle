# Prerequisites

* *Node.js* - Here's the official
  [documentation](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation).
* *Redis* - Redis is an advanced key/value store. It's where ApiAxle
  stores its data. Find [the installation
  instructions](http://redis.io/download) on redis.io.
* *NPM* - NPM is the Node package manager that ApiAxle uses to... manage its
  packages. Here are the [installation
  instructions](http://npmjs.org/).

**Note:** It's important you have the latest version of NPM
installed. The copy distributed with node itself might fail because it
assumes it needs root permissions to link the base project to the
proxy and the api code bases.

# ApiAxle

If you're willing to, run this:

    $ curl 'https://raw.github.com/apiaxle/apiaxle/master/setup-apiaxle.bash' | bash

It will checkout the three components of ApiAxle into the current
directory and all of their dependencies (by running `npm
install`).

## Trying it with the Facebook Api

Make sure you have redis installed and running. By default ApiAxle
will use the default port.

Lets say you want to put the Facebook graph API behind a proxy. Here's
how you might do it:

    $ cd apiaxle/proxy

Start the proxy service with this command:

    $ ./apiaxle_proxy.coffee 3000

It'll now listen on port `3000`. If you now hit http://localhost:3000/
you'll get an `ApiUnknown` error message. That's because ApiAxle
decides which API you want to use via subdomains. Try putting this
line in your `/etc/hosts` file:

    127.0.0.1 facebook.api.localhost

Now when you hit http://facebook.api.localhost:3000/ you'll see the
same error but with a slightly different message. That's because
ApiAxle doesn't know *how* to call facebook. There are some helper
scripts which lets us define APIs and keys. First create the api:

    $ ./bin/new-api.coffee --end-point=graph.facebook.com facebook

Now create an API key:

    $ ./bin/new-key.coffee --for-api=facebook 1234

Now try calling the graph API with any of the options you know it
accepts. Here's an example that will print our my information:

    $ curl 'http://facebook.api.localhost:3000/yet.more.information?api_key=1234'

Try it without the key and you'll get an error. If you try to hit the
API more that twice a second you'll get a Qps error.

Under the hood this has been translated to
`graph.facebook.com/yet.more.information`.

## Moving past the testing

Say you wanted to host four instances of Axle, you might use the
following snippet in your Nginx configuration (other
webservers/proxies/balancers can be used):

    upstream apiaxle_cluster {
      server 127.0.0.1:3001;
      server 127.0.0.1:3002;
      server 127.0.0.1:3003;
      server 127.0.0.1:3004;
    }

    server {
      listen 127.0.0.1:80 deferred;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://apiaxle_cluster;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
      }
    }

This assumes there are four instances running ports 3001-3004. The
balancing is simple round-robin.

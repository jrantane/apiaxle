# Api Axle

A free, locally hosted API management solution. A proxy for your api,
statistics for your api & a powerful api of its own.

There are three components which make up the Api Axle system:

## The proxy

This is the aspect of the system which does the actual proxying.

## The API

This is the (optional) API for managing users, keys and endpoints.

## The base libs

This is a set of libraries which is required for both of the above
components.
